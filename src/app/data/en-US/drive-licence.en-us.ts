It's tough because we get anxious and want to go quickly, but if you fail this, you fail immediately.</li><br><li>The famous NECK CHECK: when changing lanes or making turns, according to Australian law, you must turn your neck to check the 'blind spot'. Literally break your neck to the side! Even if you think itâ€™s not necessary, you have to do it during the test.</li><br><li>Whenever you brake to make a turn or pass through a traffic light, look in the rearview mirror. It's important for managing timing in case a car is behind you.</li><br><li>Always keep both hands firmly on the steering wheel and manage your lane entry correctly after making a turn, to prevent the evaluator from judging that you do not have control of the vehicle. There is an item on the evaluation sheet called "Performing an illegal act or manoeuvre".</li>`,
